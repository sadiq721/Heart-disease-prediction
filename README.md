Heart Disease has become one of the most prevailing disease around the world. Many cases are coming in front with no medical history and sudden heart-related diseases are detected in the population. So it has become necessary to know what are the factors which increases the risk of heart diseases and detect those signs which can lead to heart diseases.

Given Dataset is a supervised learning regression dataset having 180 patient records (rows) with 15 different health records (columns) like patient_id, slope_of_peak_exercise_st_segment, thal, resting_blood_pressure, chest_pain_type, num_major_vessels, fasting_blood_sugar_gt_120_mg_per_dl, resting_ekg_results serum_cholesterol_mg_per_dl, oldpeak_eq_st_depression, sex, age, max_heart_rate_achieved and exercise_induced_angina. These are called features. The last column 'heart_disease_present' is the target column which is labelled as '1' for heart disease present and '0' for heart disease absent.

Some of the features are binary, some are integers, some are float and some are categorical in nature. There are no Null values present in the data set.

The goal for this problem is to predict the binary class 'heart_disease_present' which represents whether or not a patient has a heart disease.
